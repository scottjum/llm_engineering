      "| Reason | Explanation |\n",
      "|--------|-------------|\n",
      "| **Deduplication** | A `set` automatically removes duplicates, so the same author name isn’t yielded twice. |\n",
      "| **Filtering** | The `if book.get(\"author\")` guard skips books that lack an author or have a blank/None value. |\n",
      "| **Memory‑efficiency** | `yield from` delegates streaming of values without building an intermediate list; however, the set itself is created in memory. If memory is a concern and you only need a *stream*, you could replace the set with a generator expression. |\n",
      "| **Readability** | The one‑liner is a terse, declarative description of “yield each unique author”. |\n",
      "| **Generator protocol** | `yield from` is the canonical way in Python 3.3+ to forward all items from a nested iterable. It behaves like a simple `for …: yield` loop but allows the nested iterable to be any iterator, and it automatically handles the nested iterator’s return value (if any). |\n",
      "\n",
      "**Caveats**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Unordered output** – Sets are unordered. If you need a deterministic order (e.g., alphabetical or the order in which authors first appear), use a list or `collections.OrderedDict`, or wrap the set in `sorted()`.\n",
      "2. **Non‑string authors** – If the author value can be non‑hashable (e.g., a list), it can’t be placed in a set. In that case you’d need a different deduplication strategy.\n",
      "3. **Large data sets** – Building a set holds all unique authors in memory. If the dataset is enormous and the list of unique authors is huge, you may want a streaming deduplication approach.\n",

      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### An alternative, more explicit version\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’d prefer something that’s maybe a bit clearer to newcomers:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def unique_authors(books):\n",
      "    authors_seen = set()\n",
      "    for book in books:\n",
      "        author = book.get(\"author\")\n",
      "        if author and author not in authors_seen:\n",
      "            authors_seen.add(author)\n",
      "            yield author\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This does the same thing—yields each unique, non‑empty author—but it shows the steps explicitly:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Look up the author.\n",
      "2. Skip if it’s falsy.\n",
      "3. Skip if we’ve already seen it.\n",
      "4. Store it and yield it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both versions are equivalent in terms of the logical result; the set‑comprehension + `yield from` is just a more compact expression of the same intent."
